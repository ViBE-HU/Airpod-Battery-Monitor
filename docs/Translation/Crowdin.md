> **Translation for GNOME42-44 branch**
> * Due to limitation of free crowdin subscription plan, GNOME43-44 branch is not available on crowdin.
> * GNOME45 and GNOME42-44 have the same strings, but GNOME43-44  have 4 additional string and they are already translated (taken from Gnome-shell).
> * To submit translation fro GNOME43-44 branch, 
>   * Translate the strings on crowdin and  submit a Pull Request to  GNOME45 branch and I will cherry-pick it to GNOME42-44 branch
>   * Or use Poedit guide, update the string using POT and submit a pull request on GNOME43-44 branch
